# Gemini Collaboration IDE
## About
Wouldn't it be benefical to code on the go? This is an iOS application that acts as an IDE that supports Python code. Developers are able to collaborate on the same code and see each other's real time updates. There is audio communication so the users can speak about the code they are working on. They can also utilize the gemini feature of the app to get code that they may need and ask questions about the code they wrote.
## Technologies
Firebase is used for the real time updates, saving on the code that was written, and keeping track of all the projects that a user has after they have logged in through authentication. AgoraKit is used for the audio communication.
